Most of this code was shamelessly taken from Binarynelle Sune's HW5 submission!
Thanks for letting me clone the code and use it myself :)

This is a simple demo of Heroku using the Twitter API.

To use this repository, you must follow these steps:
0. Sign up for the twitter developer portal at https://developer.twitter.com
1. Navigate to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps and make a new app.
2. Click on the key symbol after creating your project, and it will take you to your keys and tokens.
    If needed, you can regenerate your access token and secret.
3. Clone this repository by using git clone http://www.github.com/Sresht/lect6-heroku-complete
4. Run the following in your terminal:
    sudo pip install tweepy
    (or) sudo pip3 install tweepy
    (or) pip install tweepy
    (or) pip3 install tweepy
5. Install flask using the same process as above ([sudo] pip[3] install flask)
6. Install python-dotenv using the same process as above ([sudo] pip[3] install python-dotenv)
7. Run `python user_tweets.py`
8. If on Cloud9, preview templates/index.html
9. Sign up for heroku at heroku.com 
10. Install heroku by running npm install -g heroku
11. Add your secret keys (from step 2) by going to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
    and clicking into your app. Click on Settings, then scroll to "Config Vars." Click
    "Reveal Config Vars" and add the key value pairs for each variable in user_tweets.py
    Your config var key names should be:
    KEY=
    KEY_SECRET=
    TOKEN=
    TOKEN_SECRET
12. After adding these changes, make a new git repository and go through the following steps:
    git branch -M master
    git remote add origin [.git link to your new repository]
    git push -u origin master
    git push heroku master
13. Navigate to your newly-created heroku site!
14. If this does not load correctly, you can debug by running `heroku logs --tail` in the console.
